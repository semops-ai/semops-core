# ADR-0002: Simplified Content Data Entry - Entity or Note Only

**Status**: In Progress (implementing issue #13) 
**Date**: 2025-08-30

## Context

Initially designed a content data entry system with complex routing logic:
- Capture table → route to either Entities table OR Concepts table
- Separate handling for "entity" vs "concept" types
- Multi-select field conversion to JSON
- Complex field mappings for different target tables

During implementation, we identified a fundamental issue: the distinction between "1P concepts" and "entities" created unnecessary complexity and ambiguity.

## Decision

Collapse the data model to two clear categories:
- **Entity**: All concrete deliverables, content, and first-party concept definitions
- **Note**: Quick captures, thoughts, references, and preliminary ideas

**Rationale:**
- 1P concepts that warrant promotion become entities with `content_kind='concept'`
- This eliminates the gray area between "concept" and "entity" 
- Aligns with the single aggregate root pattern (Entity as the primary business entity)
- Simplifies data entry UX - clear binary choice

## Implementation Status

**In Progress** - Issue #13
- Airtable automation being updated to route to single Entity table
- Concept table becomes index/lookup only for 3P references
- Field mappings simplified to single target schema

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clearer mental model for content creators
- Simplified automation logic
- Reduced data duplication and sync issues
- Better alignment with domain-driven design principles

**Negative:**
- Requires migration of existing concept records
- Some loss of metadata specificity for pure reference concepts
