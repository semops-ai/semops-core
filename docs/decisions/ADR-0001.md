# ADR-0001: Use Supabase as the Global Knowledge DB

**Status**: Proposed
**Date**: 2025-08-27
**Related Issue:** [](https://github.com/semops-ai/semops-core/issues/1) (Phase 1 setup)

## Context
We need a relational + vector/graph-capable backbone for knowledge assets and lineage.

## Decision
Use Supabase (Postgres) for relational schema, pair with pgvector, and maintain pointers
to external vector/graph services if needed.

## Consequences
- Centralized schema and lineage
- Low friction for SQL + functions
- Clear upgrade path to managed Postgres
