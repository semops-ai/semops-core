# Concept-to-Pattern Mapping for semops-docs content entities
# Generated: 2026-02-17T23:56:16.492151+00:00 by bridge_content_patterns.py --extract
#
# WORKFLOW:
# 1. Review each concept below
# 2. Set action to: map | register | dismiss
# 3. For 'map': set pattern_id to an existing pattern
# 4. For 'register': add a 'register' block with new pattern fields
# 5. For 'dismiss': optionally add a note explaining why
# 6. Change status to 'reviewed' when done
# 7. Run: python scripts/bridge_content_patterns.py --apply
#
# REGISTER EXAMPLE:
# some-concept:
# action: register
# register:
# id: some-concept
# preferred_label: "Some Concept"
# definition: "A brief definition..."
# provenance: "1p"
# set_primary: true
